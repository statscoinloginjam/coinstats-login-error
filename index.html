        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Check App or Browser Version:</strong> 
                Make sure you're using the latest version of the Coinstats mobile app or accessing the updated web platform. 
                Outdated software is a frequent source of login failure.

                <strong>Reset Your Password:</strong> 
                If you’re unsure whether your credentials are correct, reset your password using the 
                <em>"Forgot Password?"</em> link. This often resolves errors tied to failed logins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clear Cache and Cookies:</strong>
